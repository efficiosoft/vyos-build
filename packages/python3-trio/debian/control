Description: Python async concurrency and I/O library
 Trio is a Python async concurrency and I/O library like Twisted or the asyncio
 standard library, but with an API rethink following lessons learned from
 asyncio and Dave Beazley's Curio. The author claims that the resulting design
 is radically simpler than older competitors like asyncio and Twisted, yet just
 as capable.
 .
 This project is young and still somewhat experimental. The API has not yet
 been declared stable. If you need more mature or with a more stable API,
 then Python's asyncio library, or the older Twisted, are probably better bets.
