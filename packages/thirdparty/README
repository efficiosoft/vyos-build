In this directory, sources for building thirdparty Debian packages that are not
available in the official repositories can be placed.

Upstream projects can be added as git submodules in this directory and the necessary
debian control files and a Makefile can be committed to a new branch (vyos) on
the submodule.

As part of the build process, all submodules in this directory are updated (and
initialized if necessary). Then, in each directory with a Makefile, "make deb"
is executed, which should produce an arbitrary number of .deb files in the parent
directory (= this one).
